## 📁 Key Files

- `/app/onlineMeeting/[id]/page.tsx`  
  Main meeting room UI. Handles device selection, participant list, video rendering, and leave logic.

- `/app/onlineMeeting/[id]/useSignalR.tsx`  
  Custom React hook for SignalR connection, signaling, peer connection management, and participant state.

## 🧩 Core Logic & Flow

### 1. User Joins Meeting

- User enters name and selects devices in a modal.
- `getUserMedia` is called to obtain local media stream.
- After local stream is ready, SignalR connection is established and user joins the room.

### 2. Signaling & Peer Connection

- SignalR handles:
  - `ParticipantsUpdated`: Keeps all clients' participant lists in sync.
  - `NewParticipant`: Notifies existing users to establish new peer connections.
  - `ReceiveSignal`: Handles WebRTC offer/answer/candidate exchange.
- Each peer connection is created only after the local stream is available, ensuring tracks are added correctly.

### 3. Media Stream Management

- Local and remote streams are managed via React refs.
- Main video area displays the selected participant's stream.
- Each participant's video is rendered in the sidebar, with the current user highlighted.

### 4. Leaving the Meeting

- On "Leave Meeting" button click:
  - SignalR `LeaveRoom` is invoked and connection is stopped.
  - User is redirected to the meeting home page.
- As a fallback, `beforeunload` event attempts to notify the server synchronously.

## ⚡ Technical Highlights & Challenges

### 🔄 WebRTC & SignalR Integration

- **Challenge:** Ensuring local media is ready before peer connections are created.
- **Solution:** Only start SignalR and peer connections after `getUserMedia` resolves.

### 🕰️ React Ref Timing

- **Challenge:** Video refs may be null if the DOM is not ready.
- **Solution:** Use `useEffect` to assign streams only after refs and streams are available.

### 🧹 Reliable Disconnection

- **Challenge:** Browsers may not wait for async operations in `beforeunload`.
- **Solution:** Main leave logic is handled on user action; `beforeunload` is a best-effort fallback using `.send`.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Participant State Consistency

- **Challenge:** Keeping all clients' participant lists and streams in sync.
- **Solution:** SignalR events update state reactively; peer connections are managed per participant.
