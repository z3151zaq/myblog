## 1. Problem-Solving: Tell me about a time you faced a difficult bug in a React project. How did you debug and fix it?

**Answer:**
Situation:
I was working on an old project that had been running smoothly for a long time but had not been updated in a while. The project required deployment on separate servers in China and Hong Kong. One day, I received a new feature request that required integrating a new package.

Task:
After finishing development and test, I was confident because the deployment went well in the test environment. So at the realease day, my goal was to successfully implement the new feature and ensure a smooth deployment in both environments without disrupting existing functionalities.

Action:
After integrating the new package, I proceeded with the deployment in China, but it failed. The issue was puzzling because the server didn’t even start Node.js, meaning there were no logs to debug. I reached out to the operations team, and they informed me that the virtual server had not been updated for a long time and required a new resource allocation. I followed their recommendation, allocated a new resource, and successfully deployed the project.

However, when deploying to Hong Kong, the deployment failed again. Assuming it was the same issue, I immediately allocated a new resource. But this time, the deployment still failed—even with the updated resource. Unlike the previous case, this time, there were logs available, which indicated a build failure due to a missing Node.js native method.

This confused me since native methods should not be missing. After further investigation, I realized that because the project was outdated, it might be using an incompatible Node.js version during the build process. Checking the logs, I discovered that:

The Hong Kong server was using Node.js 12
My local development environment was on Node.js 16
The China server and all test environment servers was using Node.js 14
This meant the issue only occurred in the Hong Kong production deployment, as the new package required a higher Node.js version than what was available.

To resolve this, I downgraded the new package to a version compatible with Node.js 12 and redeployed the project successfully.

Result:
By carefully analyzing the issue and adapting to different environments, I was able to successfully complete the deployment across both China and Hong Kong servers. This experience improved my problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of checking environment dependencies before integrating new packages in legacy projects.

## 2. Time Management: How do you prioritize multiple tasks in a React project with tight deadlines?

**Answer:**

In a React project with tight deadlines, I prioritize tasks using a mix of impact, urgency, and dependencies. First, I identify critical features that are essential for the project’s success and tackle them first. For example, if we’re building a dashboard, setting up API integration and state management would come before fine-tuning UI details.

Next, I look at dependencies—if one task is blocking others, I prioritize it to keep the team moving. I also focus on quick wins, like fixing small bugs or implementing reusable components, to maintain steady progress.

Lastly, I ensure continuous code reviews to prevent last-minute surprises. If needed, I collaborate with the team to reallocate tasks and keep everything on track.

## 3. Code Reviews: How do you handle receiving critical feedback on your React code during a code review?

First, I take a moment to stay calm—maybe by drinking a cup of water—because initial feedback, especially critical ones, can sometimes feel discouraging. Then, I carefully read through the comments to understand their reasoning. If the feedback is valid, I accept it, make the necessary improvements, and see it as an opportunity to grow. After all, having teammates who write better code than me is a great chance to learn.

However, if I disagree with the feedback, I prefer to discuss it directly with the reviewer in private. By having an open conversation, we can clarify our perspectives, and one of us may even change our mind. In the end, the goal is not to ‘win’ an argument but to write better, more maintainable code as a team.

## 4. Team Communication: Describe a situation where you had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical team member.

**Answer:**

In one project, our client wanted to share our system with another team while keeping their data and permissions completely separate. Their initial idea was to copy all our code to a new repository and deploy a private instance for the new team. While this seemed straightforward, I knew it would create long-term issues, such as doubling the maintenance workload and increasing deployment complexity.

To address this, I proposed a multi-tenancy approach, where both teams would use the same system but as separate tenants, ensuring complete data and permission isolation while maintaining a single codebase. However, the client, who was not technically inclined, struggled to understand the concept. To them, copying the system felt simpler and risk-free.

To bridge the gap, I avoided technical jargon and used a real-world analogy. I explained that their approach was like building two identical office buildings for two companies, requiring separate maintenance and updates for each. In contrast, multi-tenancy was like having one office building with separate, secure office spaces for each company—efficient, cost-effective, and just as private.

To further clarify, I created a comparison table listing the costs, risks, and benefits of both solutions. This visual breakdown helped the client see that multi-tenancy was the smarter choice. In the end, they approved my solution, and it worked perfectly—saving time, effort, and making the system easier to maintain.

## 5. Learning & Growth: React is constantly evolving. How do you stay updated with new features and best practices?

**Answer:**

I stay updated with React's latest features and best practices by reading official React documents, subscribing to React blogs like React.dev, and keeping up with updates from influential tech websites like GitHub and juejin. I also actively participate in communities like Stack Overflow. Additionally, I explore new features by writing some demos.

For example, when React introduced Server Components, I took the initiative to explore their use cases by building a small app that fetched data server-side while keeping the client-side lightweight. This helped me understand the benefits and trade-offs compared to traditional client-side rendering. This hands-on approach ensures that I not only understand new concepts but can effectively apply them in real-world scenarios.

## 6. Handling Pressure: Can you give an example of a time when you had to meet a tough deadline? How did you manage your workload?

**Answer:**

In my previous time, I once worked on a project with very limited time and cost constraints.

First of all, we must agree with the clients that we cannot complete every feature they want with this time and cost limitation. We have to prioritize the features and achieve the most high-priority features. Then, deliver an MVP. Then I synchronized this communication result with my team to see if our team leader can give us some support or other colleguess are availiable.

To manage the workload effectively, I started by breaking down tasks into smaller tasks and discussing with my colleague about every task's assignee. Due to the limited time, we adopted the agile working method. We got a dashboard document to track every task's progress and ensure that our daily work does not lag behind.

Despite all the constraints, we successfully delivered the MVP on time, and the client was impressed with the performance and usability. This experience reinforced my ability to work efficiently under pressure while maintaining code quality.

## 7. Ownership & Initiative: Have you ever suggested a new feature or improvement in a React project? What was the impact?

**Answer:**

Yes, absolutely. I was working on a financial project that involved complex forms and tables, and I found myself repeatedly writing similar code, which was time-consuming and inefficient. One day, while reading a tech blog from the Ant Design (Antd) team, I came across a newly released library designed specifically for handling heavy business scenarios like ours. This library allowed developers to create complex forms and tables using just a component and a data schema, significantly reducing development effort.

I was facinated, and I conducted research to ensure compatibility with our project. Fortunately, it integrated seamlessly without requiring any dependency updates. After implementing it, we were able to develop new features in nearly half the time. It was a significant improvement that boosted both productivity and maintainability for the team.

## 8. Conflict Resolution: Have you ever disagreed with a teammate or stakeholder on a technical decision? How did you resolve it?

**Answer:**

One time, our client wanted to share our system with another team while keeping their data and permissions completely separate. Initially, they suggested copying all our code to another repository and deploying a private instance for the new team.

However, I quickly realized that while this seemed easy at first, it would cause many problems in the long run. We would have to maintain two separate codebases, meaning every update or fix would need to be done twice, greatly increasing maintenance costs and effort.

So, I proposed another solution—multi-tenancy. This way, both teams could use the same system as separate tenants, keeping their data and permissions fully isolated while allowing us to maintain just one codebase. For them, it would feel like they had their own dedicated system.

At first, the client didn’t fully understand my approach. They thought they were simply sharing the system, not adding new features. To them, copying the system seemed easier and risk-free. However, the tech team supported my idea, so we created a comparison table showing the costs, benefits, and drawbacks of both solutions. This helped the client see that multi-tenancy was actually the best choice for their needs.

In the end, multi-tenancy worked perfectly. We achieved the client’s goal while saving a lot of time and effort, making the project more efficient and easier to manage.

## 9. Failure & Recovery: Tell me about a time something went wrong in a project. How did you handle the situation and what did you learn?

We were preparing to launch a new release when the product manager approached me with a request to include a small change. Since it was a minor feature and I completed it quickly, we decided to include it in the release as planned.

However, after deployment, some users reported a display issue. This was surprising because we had tested the page multiple times. Upon investigation, I realized that the last-minute change had unintentionally affected the page, and I hadn’t fully considered its impact. Since it affected many users, the company classified it as an incident. And it affected my monthly performance.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson: never accept unplanned changes at the last minute and never release a feature without thorough testing.
